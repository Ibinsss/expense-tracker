## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

These steps will guide you from cloning the repo to running it locally.

---

### 1. 🧬 Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/expense-tracker.git
cd expense-tracker
````

---

### 2. 📦 Install Dependencies

Make sure you have **PHP 8.1+**, **Composer**, and **Node.js** installed.

```bash
composer install
npm install && npm run build
```

---

### 3. ⚙️ Configure Your Environment

Copy the `.env.example` file and set your own environment config:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then open `.env` in your editor and make sure these values are set:

```dotenv
APP_NAME="Expense Tracker"
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_db_name
DB_USERNAME=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password

FILESYSTEM_DISK=public
```

> ℹ️ If you're using PostgreSQL or SQLite, update the `DB_` values accordingly.

---

### 4. 🔑 Generate App Key

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

---

### 5. 🧱 Run Migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This will create the necessary tables like `expenses` in your database.

---

### 6. 📂 Set Up Storage for Receipts

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

This creates a symbolic link from `storage/app/public` to `public/storage`, so that uploaded receipts can be accessed publicly.

---

### 7. 🚀 Run the App

Start the local development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Visit the app in your browser:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

## 📁 Uploads & Storage

* You can view receipts in the browser or download them directly

## 🙋 FAQ

**Q: My uploaded receipt doesn’t show up?**
Make sure you’ve run `php artisan storage:link`, and your `.env` file uses `FILESYSTEM_DISK=public`.

**Q: Can I use S3 or other cloud storage?**
Yes, but you’ll need to update your `filesystems.php` and `.env` for that.

**Q: How to reset the database?**
You can use this:

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh
```
